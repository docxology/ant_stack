# AGENTS.md

## Scope
This file applies to `tests/core_rendering`.

## Directory contract
Tests for rendering and core refactor compatibility contracts.

## Working rules
- Use `uv` for Python commands and dependency-managed execution.
- Keep changes local to this directory's responsibility unless a shared API contract requires a coordinated edit.
- Preserve generated artifacts only when they are intentional and reproducible; remove bytecode, caches, and OS metadata.
- When editing manuscript prose, keep scientific claims source-backed and soften or cite claims that are not directly supported.

## Validation
Run:
```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/core_rendering
```
