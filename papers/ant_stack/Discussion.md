# Discussion

## Significance for Myrmecology

- **Empiricism $\to$ executable theory**: Trail dynamics, polarized-light navigation, and associative olfaction become testable modules (pheromone field, ring-attractor CX, AL$\to$MB learning), enabling hypothesis tests and cross-species comparisons
- **Individuals $\to$ superorganisms**: Stigmergic composition supports division of labor, trail reinforcement, and resilience with field-measurable levers (diffusion, decay, deposit)
- **Experiment $\leftrightarrow$ field loop**: Parameters map to measurable field quantities, enabling calibration and out-of-sample prediction
- **Data leverage**: Bibliometrics and curated datasets guide species/trait prioritization and parameter ranges

## Relation to Recent Findings

- **Urgency-tuned trails**: Context-dependent deposition/following to study exploration--exploitation shifts
- **Environmental stability**: Species-parameterized noise, energy costs, terrain for robustness under heat/drought/fragmentation
- **Ant--plant mutualisms**: Resource--reward dynamics to test protection-for-nectar feedbacks and colony outcomes
- **Collective risk management**: Study alarm signaling, quorum thresholds, and evacuation under threat
- **Navigation cues**: Integrate polarized light and landmarks into CX to test cue-combination strategies

## Limitations

- No ant connectome is currently available; template from fly/bee with functional abstractions
- Real-time embedded operation is future work; scope is simulation-first reproducibility
- Field validation requires collaboration and standardized data collection protocols
 - Chemical ecology is complex; microclimate and substrate effects can shift pheromone dynamics and sensing

## Future Directions

- **Species libraries**: Parameter presets for representative taxa/ecoregions
- **Learning mechanisms**: Local plasticity beyond STDP (neuromodulated Hebbian) under energy budgets
- **Collective tasks**: Nest construction, brood care, adversarial decoys to test colony cognition
- **Validation**: Benchmarks vs field/arena datasets (trail formation, polarized-light homing, task allocation)
- **Open protocols**: Share standardized tasks and seeds to enable cross-lab replication
- **Tooling**: Programmatic APIs for species presets, parameter sweeps, and experiment manifests
 - **Systems bridges**: Minimal ROSÂ 2 bindings and message schemas; unit-registry enforcement end-to-end
 - **Security**: Counter-deception benchmarks and ablations (e.g., spoofed gradients, adversarial deposits)
