# Abstract

We present the Ant Stack: a compact, modular framework that emulates an ant from physics to cognition. It comprises three interoperable layers---`AntBody` (morphology, actuation, sensors), `AntBrain` (functional neural circuits templated from conserved insect architectures), and `AntMind` (active inference and stigmergy for individual and collective cognition). The stack uses explicit I/O contracts, sparse/low-power compute, and species-parameterized configurations aligned with current myrmecology.

The proposed methods couple physics-based locomotion and olfactory--visual sensing with a lightweight neural pipeline (local plasticity) and a minimal generative model for active-inference policy selection that composes across agents via pheromone-mediated stigmergy. We specify evaluation suites for navigation, trail following, task allocation, and robustness under noise/adversaries. The framework is reproducible, extensible, and transferable to swarm robotics and other complex systems, with open evaluation assets and baseline species configurations.

Contributions: (1) an explicit, executable Input/Output contract between proposed Body, Brain, and Mind layers; (2) a compact neural control pipeline with local plasticity; (3) a minimal active-inference ant nestmate agent that composes via stigmergy; (4) a standardized evaluation suite with species presets and seeds for direct replication; (5) a species-parameterized, manifest-driven, and version-pinned artifact set for reproducible translational entomologicalresearch.

For myrmecology, the stack links empirical findings (pheromone dynamics, polarized-light navigation, species-level diversity) to executable models for hypothesis testing and cross-species comparison. Beyond biology, it provides a tractable substrate for energy-efficient synthetic intelligence, cognitive security, and alignment research where distributed, naturally aligned agents yield resilient group behavior.
