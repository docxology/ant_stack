# Glossary

- **Active Inference (AIF)**: Agents minimize variational free energy through belief updating and policy selection
- **AL (Antennal Lobes)**: First-order olfactory processing; glomerular odor code
- **Alignment (AI)**: Consistency of behavior with intended objectives under perturbation
- **CX (Central Complex)**: Hub for heading, orientation, and action selection; often a ring attractor
- **Energy budget**: Compute/energy cost per unit behavior; critical for embedded intelligence
- **Eligibility trace**: Short-term memory of recent activity used to gate plasticity updates
- **Generative model**: Predicts sensory inputs; supports policy selection via expected free energy
- **Kenyon cells**: Sparse-coding neurons in Mushroom Bodies; associative learning
- **MB (Mushroom Bodies)**: Learning and memory; multimodal integration
- **Pheromone field**: Diffusion--decay concentration for stigmergic communication
- **Ring attractor**: Network motif for continuous heading representations
- **Sparse spiking**: Low average activity for energy efficiency
- **Stigmergy**: Indirect coordination via environmental modification (e.g., pheromone trails)
- **Tripod gait**: Hexapod locomotion using alternating tripods
- **Expected free energy (EFE)**: Balances risk and ambiguity; minimized to select actions or policies
- **Variational free energy (VFE)**: Upper bound on surprise; minimized to update beliefs and guide inference
 - **STDP (Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity)**: Local synaptic update rule driven by pre-/post-spike timing
 - **WTA (Winner-Take-All)**: Competitive selection mechanism used for action selection or sparsification
 - **Quorum sensing**: Thresholded group decision mechanism relevant to task allocation and evacuation
 - **I/O contract**: Explicit interface specifying message contents, units, and update rates between modules
 - **Unit registry**: Programmatic system for tracking and enforcing physical units across computations
 - **Epistemic value**: Information gain component of EFE
 - **Pragmatic value**: Goal-directed (extrinsic) utility component of EFE
