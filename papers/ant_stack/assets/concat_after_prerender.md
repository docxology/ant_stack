# Abstract

We present the Ant Stack: a compact, modular framework that emulates an ant from physics to cognition. It comprises three interoperable layers---`AntBody` (morphology, actuation, sensors), `AntBrain` (functional neural circuits templated from conserved insect architectures), and `AntMind` (active inference and stigmergy for individual and collective cognition). The stack uses explicit I/O contracts, sparse/low-power compute, and species-parameterized configurations aligned with current myrmecology.

The proposed methods couple physics-based locomotion and olfactory--visual sensing with a lightweight neural pipeline (local plasticity) and a minimal generative model for active-inference policy selection that composes across agents via pheromone-mediated stigmergy. We specify evaluation suites for navigation, trail following, task allocation, and robustness under noise/adversaries. The framework is reproducible, extensible, and transferable to swarm robotics and other complex systems, with open evaluation assets and baseline species configurations.

Contributions: (1) an explicit, executable Input/Output contract between proposed Body, Brain, and Mind layers; (2) a compact neural control pipeline with local plasticity; (3) a minimal active-inference ant nestmate agent that composes via stigmergy; (4) a standardized evaluation suite with species presets and seeds for direct replication; (5) a species-parameterized, manifest-driven, and version-pinned artifact set for reproducible translational entomologicalresearch.

For myrmecology, the stack links empirical findings (pheromone dynamics, polarized-light navigation, species-level diversity) to executable models for hypothesis testing and cross-species comparison. Beyond biology, it provides a tractable substrate for energy-efficient synthetic intelligence, cognitive security, and alignment research where distributed, naturally aligned agents yield resilient group behavior.

# The Ant Stack

The Ant Stack is a compact, modular framework for simulating an ant agent---body, brain, and mind---to study how robust intelligence emerges from sensorimotor grounding and collective interaction. It emphasizes biologically plausible interfaces, sparse/low-power computation, and clear I/O contracts. The aim is pragmatic: a small, interoperable stack that is easy to test, extend, and transfer to real systems.

The framework is composed of three primary layers: `AntBody`, `AntBrain`, and `AntMind`. This structure allows for a separation of concerns, where physical simulation, neural architecture, and cognitive modeling can be developed and studied independently while remaining interoperable. The goal is to build upon foundational research in other insects, such as *Drosophila* and *Apis*, to accelerate the development of a sophisticated ant model with wide-ranging applications.

# Background and State of the Art

This Introduction situates the Ant Stack within computational neuroscience, robotics, and entomology, and highlights gaps motivating a compact, interoperable framework. The emphasis is on functional fidelity, explicit interfaces, and small-footprint operation that transfers from simulation to hardware and across species.

## Key Developments

- **Neural simulators (e.g., Nengo, Spaun):** Feasibility of insect-like behaviors and decision-making; proof of concept for functional brain emulation
- **Neurokernel:** GPU-accelerated, modular simulation of the fly brain; a blueprint for ant-specific simulation
- **Ant-inspired robotics/navigation:** Swarms and navigation (visual odometry, polarized light) validate robust ant-like strategies
- **Field data pipelines:** Increasing availability of arena/field datasets enables data-driven parameterization and validation
- **Tracking/pose tools:** Open-source video tracking and pose estimation (e.g., DeepLabCut, idtracker.ai) enable parameter extraction and validation

## What Has Not Been Achieved

Despite progress, no high-fidelity ant brain emulation exists that closes the loop with a realistic body at interactive rates.

- **No complete ant connectome:** Requires templates from other insects and functional abstraction
- **No synapse-level emulation:** No model meets biological functional fidelity
- **No real-time embedded simulation:** No robot runs a full, real-time ant brain
- **Limited cross-species transfer:** Few studies quantify how models transfer across ant taxa and environments

## Technical Challenges

- **Sensorimotor integration:** Pheromones, polarized light, chemical gradients, and motor coupling
- **Connectomics:** Incomplete wiring data
- **Hardware miniaturization:** Embedded control at ant scale remains unsolved
- **Data scarcity:** Sparse, noisy, or heterogeneous ecological data complicate validation and benchmarking
- **Standardization:** Lack of common I/O contracts impedes replication and comparison
 - **Systems integration:** Bridging simulation and hardware via standardized message schemas (e.g., ROS 2) and unit registries

## Recent Conceptual Advances in AI

- **Agentic AI and world models:** `AntMind`’s generative model serves as a compact world model for goal-directed behavior
- **Compression over memorization:** Intelligence as compression; ant colonies achieve complexity with ~250k neurons/agent
- **From tokens to cognition:** Embodiment, grounding, and predictive processing over disembodied token prediction
- **Cognitive security:** Security at the cognitive layer (deception-resilient agents) as a design objective
- **Energy-aware design:** Sparse activity and local learning align with on-edge constraints

## Assumptions and Limits

- No complete ant connectome; template from Drosophila/Apis with functional abstractions
- Real-time, embedded control out of scope for v0; simulation-first with explicit I/O
- Energy/compute constraints modeled as design targets, not hardware-fitted
- Biological realism is subordinated to functional parsimony where trade-offs are explicit and documented

### Section Summary

- Prior work validates components but not a full, embodied real-time ant brain
- Data gaps and hardware constraints justify functional abstraction and simulation-first scope
- Explicit assumptions/limits enable reproducibility and focused progress


# AntBody

`AntBody` is a physics-based model of ant morphology, biomechanics, and sensors. It adapts the `FlyBody` MuJoCo simulator to ant-specific leg kinematics, exoskeletal properties, and antennae/mandible actuation (portable to PyBullet). It emits the raw sensorimotor stream to `AntBrain` and executes motor commands. The objective is not photorealism but functional fidelity: reproduce contact dynamics, gradient sensing, and actuation latencies that pose the same control problems real ants solve.

![Computational architecture diagram (6ce7)](papers/ant_stack/assets/mermaid/diagram_6ce7cc13.png){ width=70% }

## Morphology and Biomechanics

- **Segmented body:** Head, thorax, gaster with articulated joints.
- **Six articulated legs:** Multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) per leg for tripod gait and uneven terrain.
- **Mandibles and antennae:** Grasping/manipulation; near-field chemosensation.
- **Exoskeleton properties:** Rigidity and mass distribution for realistic contact.
- **Thermoregulation & hydration:** Optional environmental coupling for temperature and humidity tolerance experiments.

## Actuation and Motor Control

- **Joint actuators:** Muscle-like force generation per joint.
- **Low-level control:** Reflexive stabilization (e.g., stance) beneath `AntBrain` commands; optionally PID/impedance at joints for robust terrain contact.

## Sensory Apparatus

- **Mechanoreceptors:** Leg/body/antennal contact, forces, joint angles/velocities.
- **Ocelli/compound eyes:** Ambient luminance, polarized-light compass, low-res motion/landmarks.
- **Auditory/vibration (optional):** Substrate-borne vibration sensing for alarm/communication experiments.

Goal: a functionally accurate ant nestmate body posing the same control problems a real ant brain evolved to solve.

- **Latency budget:** End-to-end sensor$\to$actuator latency target $\le 20$ ms (configurable)
- **Synchronization:** Monotonic timebase; max drift between body and brain clocks $\le 2$ ms; timestamp every observation

Strict units and update rates enable drop-in replacement of bodies and simplify benchmarking across engines.

## Configuration

- Sensor/actuator calibration: per-channel offset/gain with auto-calibration routines and logs
- Batch mode: offline rollout/export of o_t, a_t, and internal state for dataset generation

Recommended defaults: 3--4 DOF/leg, $\Delta t = 1$ ms, $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ control, Gaussian sensor noise $\sigma \in [0.01, 0.05]$.

# AntBrain

`AntBrain` is a functional abstraction of an ant's neural architecture. It models key circuits and principles sufficient for adaptive behavior, initially at the circuit level and eventually at the cellular (neuron and glia) and synaptic level.

The architecture is templated from mapped insect brains (e.g., *Drosophila* hemibrain; *Apis* models) to remain biologically plausible and computationally tractable. Future ant-specific neuroanatomy can be mapped onto this template. Where available, species-level differences (e.g., glomerular counts, CX architecture) parameterize modules.

![Computational architecture diagram (5c37)](papers/ant_stack/assets/mermaid/diagram_5c37e240.png){ width=70% }

## Scope and Assumptions

- Functional, not synapse-accurate; modules align to conserved circuits (AL, MB, CX)
- Sparse, low-power operation at $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ closed loop; ~1e5--2.5e5 neurons (configurable)
- Local learning (e.g., STDP) with simple modulatory signals; no global backprop
- Noise is a feature: stochasticity aids exploration and regularization; parameters expose variance at module boundaries

## Template Resource: Virtual Fly Brain (VFB)

[Virtual Fly Brain (About)](https://www.virtualflybrain.org/about/) is an interactive resource for exploring the neuroanatomy, neuron connectivity, and gene expression of Drosophila melanogaster. It integrates curated literature and image datasets onto a common brain template, enabling cross-search, similarity queries, and 3D comparison of neurons and regions.

We use VFB to align region nomenclature, ground functional abstractions of AL/MB/CX in mapped fly circuits, and inform parameters where ant-specific data are sparse. Where ant data exist, we override defaults via species presets.

## Design Principles

### 1. Functional Emulation

Simulate functional roles of key structures rather than replicate every neuron. Favor minimal sufficient mechanisms with measurable interfaces.

### 2. Neural Sparsity and Efficiency

- **Neuron count:** ~250k target; biologically plausible and tractable
- **Optimization:** Low-energy computation and sparse representations
- **Dynamics:** Stochastic spiking and local learning (Hebbian, STDP)
- **Neuromodulation:** Reward/aversive signals (dopamine, octopamine, other biogenic amines) gate plasticity and policy bias
  with per-task schedules exported for reproducibility

### 3. Integration

- **Sensorimotor loops:** Tight closed loop with `AntBody`
- **Behavioral modules:** Substrate for higher-level programs orchestrated by `AntMind`
- **Multi-modal fusion:** AL/MB olfaction with visual/vestibular cues into CX heading and action channels
  with explicit timing constraints to maintain closed-loop stability at $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$

## Implementation Notes

- Engine: spiking (Brian2 / Nengo / SpikingJelly) or hybrid rate-based
- I/O: map `AntBody` observations to AL$\to$MB$\to$CX; policy head drives CX motor channel
- Interfaces are stable and testable: each module exposes a minimal API with typed tensors and unit metadata.
- **Cross-module timing:** AL/MB update at $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$; CX policy head 50--$100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ depending on task
- Learning:
  - MB: sparse coding (Kenyon cells); local plasticity with reward/punishment gating
  - CX: ring-attractor heading; soft WTA for action selection
- Targets: neurons ~1e5--2.5e5; sparse activity; $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ closed-loop
- **Memory:** short-term eligibility traces; long-term synaptic consolidation checkpoints for reproducibility; model cards documenting learning rules and seeds
 - Neuromodulation API: dopamine/octopamine gating channels exposed via a minimal interface for reproducible learning schedules
 - Footprint reporting: track neuron counts, parameter sizes, and update rates per module

## Key Neural Circuits and Their Functions

While a full connectome is absent, we can model the primary functions of key, conserved insect brain regions.

- **Antennal Lobes (AL):** This is the first-order olfactory processing center. It receives input from chemosensors on the antennae and organizes odor information into a combinatorial code. Different odors evoke unique patterns of glomerular activation, forming a "scent signature" that is passed to higher brain centers.
- **Mushroom Bodies (MB):** The MB is a critical center for associative learning and memory, homologous to the hippocampus in vertebrates. It receives processed olfactory information from the AL and integrates it with other sensory modalities and internal state information. Its sparse coding scheme, enforced by a large number of Kenyon cells, is ideal for forming and storing specific memories, such as linking an odor to a food reward or a threat.
- **Central Complex (CX):** This is a highly-structured region crucial for spatial navigation, goal-directed behavior, and action selection. It integrates sensory cues (especially visual information like polarized light for sky-compass navigation) to maintain a representation of the ant's heading and orientation relative to its environment. It plays a key role in translating high-level goals (e.g., "return to the nest") into specific directional motor commands.

### Section Summary

- Efficiency and configurability prioritized over full connectomic fidelity


# AntMind

`AntMind` is the cognitive layer bridging `AntBrain` with symbolic abstraction and collective intelligence. It specifies how individual agents decide and how those decisions compose into colony-level intelligence. The focus is on minimal, testable machinery that scales from one agent to many without changing local rules.

![Computational architecture diagram (3c9d)](papers/ant_stack/assets/mermaid/diagram_3c9d265c.png){ width=70% }

## Scope and Assumptions

- Active Inference links perception and action via a compact generative model
- Symbolic abstraction emerges from grounded sensorimotor predictions
- Colony cognition uses stigmergy and sparse sharing; no centralized controller
- Policies are small: short horizons ($\le 2$ s), low channel counts, and local updates favor transparency and transfer

## Key Concepts

### Individual Cognition: Active Inference

- **Predictive processing:** Perception updates a generative model to reduce prediction error
- **Free Energy Principle:** Actions minimize expected free energy over time
- **Symbolic grounding:** Symbols emerge from sensorimotor predictions (supports the “triple equivalence”)
- **Risk sensitivity:** Preferences encode risk/ambiguity attitudes; policy selection trades off exploration vs exploitation

### Collective Intelligence: Emergence via Stigmergy

- **Stigmergy:** Environmental traces (pheromones) coordinate behavior; the trail is the memory
- **Distributed cognition:** Memory, decision-making, and learning are shared across agents and environment
- **Low-footprint:** ~250k neurons/agent with simple rules yield rich emergent intelligence
- **Resilience:** Redundant environmental memory (pheromones) and local priors improve recovery from deception

### From Sub-symbolic to Symbolic Cognition

The stack offers a pathway from sub-symbolic processing to symbolic reasoning via grounded predictions. Symbols are treated as compressed, re-usable predictions tied to tasks and sensory contexts.

## Minimal Generative Model (Single Agent)

- Latent state s_t: pose, heading, internal drive (hunger), local pheromone expectation
- Observation o_t: from `AntBody` I/O
- Action a_t: joint targets
- Preferences: priors over outcomes (food proximity$\uparrow$, energy cost$\downarrow$, collision$\downarrow$)
- Constraints: energy budget and temperature/humidity limits (optional) shape expected free energy
- Update: variational free energy minimization (amortized); policy selection over 0.5--2.0 s
- Rates: control $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$; policy update $10\,\mathrm{Hz}$
- Diagnostics: report expected free energy terms (risk, ambiguity), action entropy, and policy dwell time
 - Diagnostics: report EFE decomposition (epistemic/pragmatic value), action entropy, policy dwell time, and constraint violations

## Pheromone Field (Stigmergy)

- Grid $c_t(x)$: $c_{t+1} = (1-\lambda)\,c_t + D\,\nabla^2 c_t + \sum \text{deposits}$
- Parameters: $\lambda$ decay, $D$ diffusion; deposits increase on reward return
- Agents follow $\nabla$c; following probability rises with |$\nabla$c|
- Interfaces: deposit/read operations are unit-aware; decay and diffusion are version-pinned for replication
 - Stability: saturation/clipping on c_t and deposit rates to prevent runaway trails; optional anisotropic diffusion under wind

## Colony-Level Arbitration

- Federated active inference: local beliefs shared sparsely via stigmergy; no central controller
- Task allocation: soft constraints via internal drives and pheromone-mediated opportunities
- Safety: monitor for deceptive gradients; trigger re-exploration and attenuate deposit under conflict
 - Belief sharing: lossy compression of shared statistics (e.g., recent reward rates, local gradient summaries)

### Section Summary

- Cognitive bridge from neural substrate to behavior and collective intelligence
- Minimal, testable generative model with explicit stigmergy dynamics
- Small-footprint policies that compose across agents

# Discussion

## Significance for Myrmecology

- **Empiricism $\to$ executable theory**: Trail dynamics, polarized-light navigation, and associative olfaction become testable modules (pheromone field, ring-attractor CX, AL$\to$MB learning), enabling hypothesis tests and cross-species comparisons
- **Individuals $\to$ superorganisms**: Stigmergic composition supports division of labor, trail reinforcement, and resilience with field-measurable levers (diffusion, decay, deposit)
- **Experiment $\leftrightarrow$ field loop**: Parameters map to measurable field quantities, enabling calibration and out-of-sample prediction
- **Data leverage**: Bibliometrics and curated datasets guide species/trait prioritization and parameter ranges

## Relation to Recent Findings

- **Urgency-tuned trails**: Context-dependent deposition/following to study exploration--exploitation shifts
- **Environmental stability**: Species-parameterized noise, energy costs, terrain for robustness under heat/drought/fragmentation
- **Ant--plant mutualisms**: Resource--reward dynamics to test protection-for-nectar feedbacks and colony outcomes
- **Collective risk management**: Study alarm signaling, quorum thresholds, and evacuation under threat
- **Navigation cues**: Integrate polarized light and landmarks into CX to test cue-combination strategies

## Limitations

- No ant connectome is currently available; template from fly/bee with functional abstractions
- Real-time embedded operation is future work; scope is simulation-first reproducibility
- Field validation requires collaboration and standardized data collection protocols
 - Chemical ecology is complex; microclimate and substrate effects can shift pheromone dynamics and sensing

## Future Directions

- **Species libraries**: Parameter presets for representative taxa/ecoregions
- **Learning mechanisms**: Local plasticity beyond STDP (neuromodulated Hebbian) under energy budgets
- **Collective tasks**: Nest construction, brood care, adversarial decoys to test colony cognition
- **Validation**: Benchmarks vs field/arena datasets (trail formation, polarized-light homing, task allocation)
- **Open protocols**: Share standardized tasks and seeds to enable cross-lab replication
- **Tooling**: Programmatic APIs for species presets, parameter sweeps, and experiment manifests
 - **Systems bridges**: Minimal ROS 2 bindings and message schemas; unit-registry enforcement end-to-end
 - **Security**: Counter-deception benchmarks and ablations (e.g., spoofed gradients, adversarial deposits)

## Synthesis: An Integrative Systems Approach

- **Methodological innovation**: Fuse `FORMINDEX` (data-centric) with `ActiveInferAnts` (agent-based). Plausible agents (`AntBody`, `AntBrain`) within `AntMind` bridge individual behavior and ecosystem-level phenomena. A small set of unit-aware interfaces keeps modules swappable and testable.
- **Transferable framework**: Generalizable principles for swarm robotics and cognitive security
- **Open science**: Open, reproducible, transparent methodology for embodied and collective intelligence
