**Usage Note**: These coefficients are applied consistently across all energy calculations, scaling analyses, and efficiency comparisons. Any deviation from these values is explicitly noted.

## B. Detailed Measurement Protocols

**Power Meter Calibration and Environmental Controls**:
- Calibrate all power measurement instruments against NIST-traceable standards before each experimental session
- Record and maintain stable ambient conditions: temperature (20$\pm$2$^\circ$C), humidity (45$\pm$5%), and minimize electromagnetic interference
- Pin all software versions including operating system, drivers, libraries, and analysis frameworks
- Document hardware specifications including CPU model, memory configuration, and thermal management settings

**Experimental Reproducibility Standards**:
- Report deterministic seeds for all pseudorandom number generation across statistical bootstrap sampling
- Version and archive message schema definitions and unit registry entries for long-term reproducibility
- Maintain synchronized timestamps across all measurement systems with sub-millisecond accuracy
- Implement automated validation checks for measurement consistency and outlier detection

## C. Comprehensive Parameter Tables and System Configurations

**Module Scaling Parameters by Platform Type**:
- **Hexapod Configuration**: J=18 (6 legs $\times$ 3 joints), C=12 (typical stance contacts), S=256 (multi-modal sensing)
- **Quadruped Configuration**: J=12 (4 legs $\times$ 3 joints), C=8 (reduced contact complexity), S=128 (streamlined sensing)
- **Biped Configuration**: J=12 (2 legs $\times$ 6 joints), C=4 (minimal contacts), S=192 (enhanced proprioception)

**Neural System Parameter Ranges**:
- AL input channels (K): 64-512 depending on sensory modality emphasis and computational budget
