# Computational Complexity and Energetics of the Ant Stack

## Overview and Research Objectives

This research presents a comprehensive analysis of computational complexity and energetics for the Ant Stack, an integrated framework for embodied artificial intelligence. As a companion paper to The Ant Stack, our work focuses specifically on algorithmic complexity characterization, detailed energy modeling, and empirical scaling property analysis. The document structure mirrors the primary paper to enable direct side-by-side comparison and support fully reproducible computational builds.

**Research Philosophy**: Our approach represents a significant departure from traditional AI complexity analysis by integrating energy estimation directly with complexity characterization to inform practical design trade-offs. We monitor workload and environmental complexity in real-time and develop adaptive algorithms that adjust computational effort accordingly. 

For example, we implement early-stopping planning strategies when expected energy savings diminish, following principles established in compute-energy integrated motion planning (CEIMP) methodologies \href{https://lean.mit.edu/papers/ceimp-icra}{(Sudhakar et al., 2020)}.

**Methodological Foundation**: Our energy modeling leverages device-level energy coefficients and workload-specific counters to provide accurate Joules-per-decision estimates \href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5440129}{(Koomey et al., 2011)}. This approach enables hardware-agnostic analysis while maintaining the precision necessary for energy-constrained system optimization. 

Additional methodological context draws from established scientific computing standards and rigorous reference practices to ensure reproducible and verifiable results. All methods are tested and validated through comprehensive testing.

## Roadmap & Contributions

- Derive $\mathcal{O}(\cdot)$ complexity and constants for body, brain, and mind loops

- Quantify actuation energy under terrain/material parameters
- Provide standardized profiling harnesses and manifest-driven experiments
- Report scaling laws across agents, sensors, and policies
